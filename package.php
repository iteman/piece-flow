## Enhancements ##

### Piece_Flow_Continuation ###

- Added getFlowExecutionTicketByFlowName() method for getting a flow execution ticket by the given flow name. (Ticket #5)

### Piece_Flow_Action_Invoker, Piece_Flow_Action ###

- Added the code so as to be able to prepare something for a callback before invoking the callback. (Ticket #6)

### Other Changes ###

- Changed so as to be able to omit the class attribute for a callback. If the class attribute is omitted, ClassNameAction class is used. (Ticket #8)

## Defect Fixes ##

### Piece_Flow_Continuation ###

- Changed the behaviour of preparing flow execution so as to require a flow execution ticket whenever continuing a flow execution even though what the flow execution mode is. (Ticket #2)
- Changed the behaviour of preparing flow execution so as to require a flow name whenever in multiple flow mode. (Ticket #3)';
